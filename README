**** NOT READY YET ****
	Alisto is yet another 3D printer firmware. The aim is to learn from the other great 
3D printer firmwares and incorporate the things that makes them good. The source code 
should be clean and easily moddable so you won't say "WHY IS 90% OF YOUR CODE BASE MADE OF MACROS!" 
	
	Right now this project is on designing phase, using Qt graphical components to visualize 
the movements of this proposed 3D printer firmware.
